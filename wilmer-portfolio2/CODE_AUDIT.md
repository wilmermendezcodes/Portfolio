# Code Audit Report

## Overview
This repository contains a small React portfolio website. The entry point
is `my‑app/src/App.jsx`, which renders a responsive Material‑UI app bar and a
footer. The UI is composed of several functional components that display
static content (About Me, Experience, Skills) and a simple typing animation.

## Detected Warnings
- **Recursive `setTimeout` in `simulateTyping`** – the typing effect creates a
  new timeout for each character. For short strings this is harmless, but a
  very long string could generate many pending timers.
- **Large fixed widths (`2000px`)** – several components set a fixed width of
  `2000px`. This may cause layout issues on smaller screens and is not
  responsive.
- **Hard‑coded image import** – the portrait image is imported directly from
  `../wilmermendez.jpg`. If the image is missing the build will fail.

## Security Issues
- **No user‑controlled input** – the application does not accept any external
  data, so classic XSS, SQLi, or command‑injection vectors are absent.
- **No use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` or `eval`** – safe from injection.
- **Static resources only** – all assets are bundled at build time; no dynamic
  file reads (`fs`, `require`) are performed.

## Suggested Fixes / Improvements
1. **Guard the typing effect** – add a check to clear pending timers when the
   component unmounts to avoid memory leaks.
   ```jsx
   React.useEffect(() => {
     const timer = simulateTyping(characters);
     return () => clearTimeout(timer);
   }, []);
   ```
2. **Make layout responsive** – replace fixed pixel widths with relative
   units (`max‑width: 100%`, Flexbox, or MUI's `sx` breakpoints).
3. **Add fall‑back for missing images** – use the `onError` handler on the
   `<Avatar>` to display a placeholder if the portrait cannot be loaded.
4. **Enable linting / type checking** – add ESLint and optionally TypeScript or
   PropTypes to catch prop mismatches and unused variables.

The project is generally well‑structured for a personal portfolio and does not
exhibit any immediate security concerns. Implementing the above usability
improvements will make the site more robust and maintainable.
